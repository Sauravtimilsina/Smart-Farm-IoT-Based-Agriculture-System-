# 🌱 Smart Farm – IoT-Based Agriculture System

## 📝 Project Description
A group-based smart farming system using Arduino and DHT11 sensors to automate irrigation. The system monitors environmental conditions (temperature and humidity) and activates water flow when needed, reducing manual effort and optimizing resource usage.

## ⚙️ Tools & Components
- **Arduino UNO**
- **Embedded C**
- **DHT11 Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **Relay Module**
- **Submersible Water Pump**
- **Breadboard and Connecting Wires**

## 💡 Key Features
- Monitors environmental data using DHT11
- Automatically triggers irrigation based on threshold values
- Designed for low-cost and small-scale farming
- Enhances efficiency with minimal hardware
